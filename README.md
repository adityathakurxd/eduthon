# **Are you good bro?**

**“Healing takes time, and asking for help is a courageous step”**

Many students face mental health issues but are completely unaware about it. The problem stems from a lack of awareness about mental health.  You might be experiencing the symptoms but be unsure of what it is and if it can be cured.
